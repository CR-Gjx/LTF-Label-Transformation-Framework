# LTF-Label-Transformation-Framework
The codes of paper "LTF: A Label Transformation Framework for Correcting Target Shift" on ICML2020.

## Requirements

* PyTorch
* Python 3.6.5


## Training
To train the LTF models, you need to download the pre-trained generative model in the https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11UjBGD8LcVI2KlKJ_lFu-G9OrumvcASy?usp=sharing, and unzip it as **result** folder.

To run the experiment for the fashion-mnist dataset:
```
$ python main.py --dataset='f-m'  --num_class=10 --c_epochs=20
```
dataset:
	*f-m: fashion mnist 
	* mnist: mnist
	* cifar10: GcGAN-vf
 
num_class: The number of classes is 10


c_epochs: The training epochs for the classifier.

tweak:  target shift setting
	* 0: Random Dirichlet Shift. In this shift, we randomly gener-ate a label distributionPTYby employing the Dirichletdistribution with different values of the concentration parameter Î±.
	* 1: Tweak-One Shift. To evaluate the performance on the largelabel probability quantification.  In our experiments,the ratio of one class is set to[0.5,0.6,0.7,0.8,0.9],respectively, while ratios of other classes are uniform,
	* 2: Minority-Class Shift. To evaluate the performance on thesmall label probability quantification.  In our experi-ments,[20%,30%,40%,50%]classes are set to 0.001,respectively, while ratios of other classes are uniform.

The results are shown as the output file, e.g. outputf-m010.txt
